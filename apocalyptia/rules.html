                    When you want to attempt a difficult action, roll one six-sided die (“d6”) to decide a fair outcome. Added to the d6 roll is the Character’s score in a Trait, Instinct, or Skill, depending on the action. Finally, add or subtract from the roll any modifiers relevant to the circumstances, as determined by the Game Narrator (“GN”). The formula for a roll is always shown in [brackets]. Calculate the Result of a d6 roll as follows:
                    <div class="centered">
                        [d6 roll + Score &#177; Modifiers] = Result

                    <div class="rule-header">Difficulty (#)</div> The Result of your roll must equal or exceed to the Difficulty number to be successful. Difficulties are indicated by the # symbol. The GN or an opposing roll set the # for your rolls.

                        <div class="rule-header">Rote Actions</div> If your [(Score + Modifiers) &gt= #] before the d6 roll, and you can take your time, you Succeed automatically.

                <div id="botch" class="rule">
                    <div class="rule-header">Botch (1)</div> If you roll 1 on a die, re-roll to check for a Botch. If a 1 is rolled again, you Botch, meaning you fail very badly. For any other number, your d6 roll is just a 1. Bonus rolls from Exploding dice do not Botch.
                    <br>
                    The GN is given a great deal of lattitude to be creative when determining the effects of Botching under various circumstances, but they should always be fair. Whenever a Character Botches, they get +1 Experience Point because we learn the most from our greatest failures.
