                    DICE RULES
                </div>
                <div>
                    When you want to attempt a difficult action, roll one six-sided die (“d6”) to decide a fair outcome. Added to the d6 roll is the Character’s score in a Trait, Instinct, or Skill, depending on the action. Finally, add or subtract from the roll any modifiers relevant to the circumstances, as determined by the Game Narrator (“GN”). The formula for a roll is always shown in [brackets]. Calculate the Result of a d6 roll as follows:
                </div>
                <div class="centered">
                    [d6 roll + Score &#177; Modifiers] = Result
                </div>
                <div>
                    <span class="section-header">Difficulty (#):</span> The Result of your roll be greater than or equal to the Difficulty number to be successful. Difficulties are indicated by the # symbol. The GN or an opposing roll set the # for your rolls.

                    <br>
                    The GN is given a great deal of lattitude to be creative when determining the effects of Botching under various circumstances, but they should always be fair. Whenever a Character Botches, they get +1 Experience Point because we learn the most from our greatest failures.
