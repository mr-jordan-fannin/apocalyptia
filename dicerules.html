    DICE RULES
  </div>
  <div>
    When you want to attempt a difficult task, use one six-sided die (d6) to decide a fair outcome. The formula for a roll is always shown in [brackets]. Whenever a rules formula involves a fraction, always round down. Calculate the Result of a d6 roll as follows:
  </div>
  <div class="centered">
    [d6 roll + (Trait, Instinct, or Skill) &#177; modifiers] = Result
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Difficulty (#)</span>: This is how hard it is to perform a task. The Result of your roll must equal or exceed this number to be successful.   Difficulties are indicated by the # symbol. The GN sets the # and gives modifiers when appropriate. The Players add their modifiers to their roll to get a Result.
    <div class="centered">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>3#</td>
          <td>Simple</td>
          <td>6#</td>
          <td>Typical</td>
          <td>9#</td>
          <td>Hard</td>
          <td>12#</td>
          <td>Extreme</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Success (S)</span>: If [Result >= #], the attempted action worked. Re-roll ties on opposed rolls. The degree of Success is important for some rolls.
    <ul>
      <li class="indent">
        <span class="section-header">Rote</span>: If your [Result >= #] before making the d6 roll, and you can take your time on the task, you Succeed automatically.
      </li>
      <li class="indent">
        <span class="section-header">Cooperation</span>: If Characters want to help each other perform a task, they all roll at once but only the best roll is used, unless someone Botches (see below) in which case the Botch is used.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Fail (F)</span>: If [Result < #], the attempted action did not work.
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Explode (6)</span>: If a 6 is rolled, roll it again and again as long as 6's continue. Add the rolls together with any modifiers to get your Result.
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Botch (1)</span>: If you roll 1 on a die, re-roll to check for a Botch. If a 1 is rolled again, you Botch, meaning you fail very badly. For any other roll, calculate your Result as usual.
    <br>Exploding rolls do not Botch. Skills usually list their Botch effects. The GN may add more or different negative effects depending on the circumstances of the Botch. When you Botch, get +1 Experience Point.
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Rolling on Tables</span>: Number column headers labeled d66 or d666 indicate that you must roll two or three d6s (one for each number column) to get a random row on the table.
  </div>
