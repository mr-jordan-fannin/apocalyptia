DICE RULES
When you want to attempt a difficult action, roll one six-sided die (“d6”) to decide a fair outcome. Added to the d6 roll is the Character’s score in a Trait, Instinct, or Skill, depending on the action. Finally, add or subtract from the roll any modifiers relevant to the circumstances, as determined by the Game Narrator (“GN”). The formula for a roll is always shown in [brackets]. Calculate the Result of a d6 roll as follows:
[d6 roll + Score &#177; Modifiers] = Result

Difficulty (#)
The Result of your roll must equal or exceed to the Difficulty number to be successful. Difficulties are indicated by the # symbol. The GN or an opposing roll set the # for your rolls.

Success (S)
If [Result &gt= #], the attempted action worked. Re-roll ties on opposed rolls. The degree of Success is important for some rolls.

Rote Actions
If your [(Score + Modifiers) &gt= #] before the d6 roll, and you can take your time, you Succeed automatically.

Cooperation
If Characters want to help each other perform a task, they all roll at once but only the best roll is used, unless someone Botches (see below) in which case the Botch is used.

Fail (F)
If [Result &lt #], the attempted action did not work.

Explode (6)
If a 6 is rolled, re-roll it again and again as long as 6's continue. Add all of these d6 rolls together, then calculate your Result.

Botch (1)
If you roll 1 on a die, re-roll to check for a Botch. If a 1 is rolled again, you Botch, meaning you fail very badly. For any other number, your d6 roll is just a 1. Bonus rolls from Exploding dice do not Botch.
The GN is given a great deal of lattitude to be creative when determining the effects of Botching under various circumstances, but they should always be fair. Whenever a Character Botches, they get +1 Experience Point because we learn the most from our greatest failures.

Tables
Number column headers (d6, d66, d666) indicate that you must roll one, two, or three d6s (one per number column) to get a random row.

Rounding
When a rule involves a fraction, always round down.
