TRAITS

The four Traits range from 1 to 6. You get 12 points for Traits. Trait rolls are [d6 + Trait]. Trait scores set the upper limit for their Skills. The average person would have a 3 in each Trait.

Trait Flow
Once per year (in-game), you may choose to move 1 point from one Trait to another for 24XP. Traits can only be changed by Â±1 in this way. Recalculate any associated Instincts and Properties.

Instincts are derived from their parent Trait.

Stealth

Make only one Move each rnd to remain Concealed. When not rolling, your Stealth score sets the # for enemy Perception rolls. Targets are Defenseless against Concealed ATKs.

Perception
= [B]. This is rapidly processing you sensory input. Spend 1AP to roll Perception to search, vs Stealth to detect a Concealed enemy, vs Survival to track, or vs Socialize or Perform to discern intentions. When not rolling, your Perception score sets the # for enemy Stealth or any other roll opposed by Perception.
