COMBAT

Combat time occurs in 3-second “rounds” (rnds). Each Player gets a turn each rnd. Either the GN decides or rolls [A vs A] to determine who goes first. At the end of each turn, the Player gets to choose who will go next among those who have not had a turn yet this rnd. At the end of the rnd, all DMG is applied simultaneously and the last Player to act decides who will start the next round.

Action Points (AP)
Perform Actions by spending Action Points. Your maximum AP = [A / 2]. AP refills at the beginning of your next turn. Unless otherwise noted, all Actions cost 1AP. You may spend AP on your turn to hold a specific Action to be used at a later time. Otherwise, if it is not your turn, you can only Defend.

Movement
Spend 1AP to move up to your Speed [A + C]. To Run, spend all of your AP this rnd and each move is [Speed x4]. Spend 1AP to drop Prone or stand up.

Attack (ATK)
There are MATKs (Melee) and RATKs (Ranged). Roll [d6 + MATK or RATK] vs Defense (DEF). Explosions are re-rolled and added to ATK. Bonus DMG = [ATK - DEF] up to Melee or Ranged.

Defense (DEF)
1AP to defend against an ATK with Block [d6 + Melee] or Dodge [d6 + Acrobatics]. When unaware of the ATK or otherwise unable to avoid it, you are Defenseless and must use Reflex for DEF. A Botch means you fall Prone (Dodge) or drop your weapon (Block).

Reflex
= [Perception]. Default DEF score. No roll. No AP spent.

Health (HP)
= [C x 2]. HP is temporarily reduced when you take DMG. Go Unconscious at 0 HP and die at [-C] HP.

Bleeding
Starts when DMG drops you to [HP / 2]. 1 DMG per minute. Roll [C vs DMG] once per minute to stop Bleeding naturally. Roll [Medicine(First-Aid) vs DMG] to stop Bleeding with a bandage.

Recovery
Roll [C vs DMG] once per day to heal 1HP. On a Fail, take 1 DMG from infection.

Death
Make a new Character with bonus XP = [old Total XP / 2].

Damage (DMG)
ATKs do DMG to HP = [Weapon DMG + Success]. DMG adds Pain penalties to all rolls and Speed. If one ATK does [DMG &gt C], you fall Prone.

Armor (DR)
DR reduces DMG. -1 DR if [DMG &gt DR].

Fire (FDMG)
When you take FDMG, 1FDMG is permanent. Only Fire-Resistant (FR) Armor reduces FDMG.

Pain
-1 to all rolls and Speed.

Vehicles
Roll [Drive(Ram) vs Drive(Stunt)] to hit an enemy vehicle. If [loser’s DR &lt= winner’s DR], or if a vehicle takes [DMG &gt DR], the vehicle gets a Condition. 0 DR disables a vehicle. A Botch is a Wreck.

Conditions
-1 DR and -1 Handling. Roll [Drive 9#] to maintain control upon getting a Condition, otherwise the vehicle Wrecks.

Occupants
Passengers in a moving vehicle are Unstable. A vehicle provides Cover from RATKs with its DR.

Pedestrians
Hitting a pedestrian does DMG = [vehicle DR]. -1 DR after hitting pedestrians = [vehicle DR].

Tires
Roll [-3 ATK vs Drive(Stunt)] to destroy a tire. If the tire is destroyed, the driver must roll [Drive 9#] or Wreck. If a front tire gets destroyed, the vehicle Wrecks automatically.

Wreck
The vehicle comes to a violent stop suddenly this rnd. Occupants take [d6 DMG per 30yds of Speed] and are ejected from the vehicle, unless they are wearing seat belts, in which case the DMG is halved and they remain in their seats.

Burning
If the Vehicle is at 0DR, it bursts into flames doing 1FDMG per rnd to all Occupants. It continues to burn for 1 minute per gallon of Fuel.
