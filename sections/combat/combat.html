COMBAT

	Combat time occurs in 3-second “rounds” (rnds). Each Player gets a turn each rnd. Either the GN decides or rolls [A vs A] to determine who goes first. At the end of each turn, the Player gets to choose who will go next among those who have not had a turn yet this rnd.
	At the end of the rnd, all DMG is applied simultaneously and the last Player to act decides who will start the next round.

Action Points (AP): Perform Actions by spending Action Points.
Your maximum AP is the average of your [A] and [B]. AP refills at the beginning of your next turn. Unless otherwise noted, all Actions cost 1AP.
	You may spend AP on your turn to hold a specific Action to be used at a later time. Otherwise, if it is not your turn, you can only Defend.

Movement: Move once per rnd up to your Speed [A + C], or spend 2AP to Run at [Speed x 2]. Spend 1AP to drop Prone or stand up.

Attack (ATK): There are MATKs (Melee) and RATKs (Ranged).
Roll [d6 + MATK or RATK] vs Defense (DEF). Explosions are re-rolled and added to ATK. Bonus DMG = [ATK - DEF] up to Melee or Ranged.

Defense (DEF): 1AP to defend against an ATK with Block [d6 + Melee] or Dodge [d6 + Acrobatics]. When unaware of the ATK or otherwise unable to avoid it, you are Defenseless and must use Reflex for DEF.
A Botch means you fall Prone (Dodge) or drop your weapon (Block).

    • Reflex: = [Perception] Default DEF score. No roll. No AP spent.

Health (HP): = [C x 3]. HP is temporarily reduced when you take DMG.
You fall Prone and start Bleeding at [HP / 2] and remain so until healed. Go Unconscious at 0 HP and die at [-C] HP. 

    • Bleeding: When your HP drops below [HP / 2], you begin losing 1HP per minute. Roll [C vs total DMG] once per minute to stop naturally or [Medicine(First-Aid) vs total DMG] with a bandage.
      
    • Recovery: After a day of rest, roll [C vs total DMG] to heal 1HP.
      On a Fail, take 1 DMG from infection.
      
    • Death: Make a new Character with bonus XP = [old Total XP / 2].

Damage (DMG): ATKs do DMG to HP = [Weapon DMG + Success].
All DMG adds Pain and causes Bleeding. If [DMG > C] you fall Prone.

    • Armor (DR): DR reduces DMG. -1 DR if [DMG > DR].
      
    • Fire (FDMG): When you take FDMG, 1FDMG is permanent.
      Only Fire-Resistant (FR) Armor reduces FDMG.
      
    • Pain: -1 to all rolls and Speed. Go unconscious if [Pain > (C+D)].

Vehicles: Roll [Drive(Ram) vs Drive(Stunt)] to hit an enemy vehicle.
If [loser’s DR <= winner’s DR], or if a vehicle takes [DMG > DR], the vehicle gets a Condition. 0 DR disables a vehicle. A Botch is a Wreck.

    • Conditions: -1 DR and -1 Handling. Roll [Drive 9#] to maintain control upon getting a Condition, otherwise the vehicle Wrecks.

    • Occupants: Passengers in a moving vehicle are Unstable.
      A vehicle provides Cover from RATKs with its DR.

    • Pedestrians: Hitting a pedestrian does DMG = [vehicle DR].
      -1 DR after hitting pedestrians = [vehicle DR].

    • Tires: Roll [-3 ATK vs Drive(Stunt)] to destroy a tire.
      If the tire is destroyed, the driver must roll [Drive 9#] or Wreck.
      If a front tire gets destroyed, the vehicle Wrecks automatically.

    • Wreck: The vehicle comes to a violent stop suddenly this rnd. 
      Occupants take [d6 DMG per 30yds of Speed] and are ejected from the vehicle, unless they are wearing seat belts, in which case the DMG is halved and they remain in their seats.
        ◦ Burning: If the Vehicle is at 0DR, it bursts into flames doing 1FDMG per rnd to all Occupants. It continues to burn for 1 minute per gallon of Fuel.
