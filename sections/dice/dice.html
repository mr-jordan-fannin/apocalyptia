    DICE RULES
  </div>
  <div>
    When you want to attempt a difficult action, roll one six-sided die (“d6”) to decide a fair outcome. Added to the d6 roll is the Character’s score in a Trait, Instinct, or Skill, depending on the action. Finally, add or subtract from the roll any modifiers relevant to the circumstances, as determined by the Game Narrator (“GN”). The formula for a roll is always shown in [brackets]. Calculate the Result of a d6 roll as follows:
  </div>
  <div class="centered">
    [d6 roll + Score &#177; Modifiers] = Result
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Difficulty (#)</span>: The Result of your roll be greater than or equal to the Difficulty number to be successful. Difficulties are indicated by the # symbol. The GN or an opposing roll set the # for your rolls.
    <div class="centered">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>3#</td>
          <td>Simple</td>
          <td>6#</td>
          <td>Typical</td>
          <td>9#</td>
          <td>Hard</td>
          <td>12#</td>
          <td>Extreme</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Success (S)</span>: If [Result >= #], the attempted action worked. Re-roll ties on opposed rolls. The degree of Success is important for some rolls.
    <ul>
      <li class="indent">
        <span class="section-header">Rote Actions</span>: If your [(Score + Modifiers) >= #] before the d6 roll, and you can take your time, you Succeed automatically.
      </li>
      <li class="indent">
        <span class="section-header">Cooperation</span>: If Characters want to help each other perform a task, they all roll at once but only the best roll is used, unless someone Botches (see below) in which case the Botch is used.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Fail (F)</span>: If [Result < #], the attempted action did not work.
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Explode (6)</span>: If a 6 is rolled, re-roll it again and again as long as 6's continue. Add all of these d6 rolls together, then calculate your Result.
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Botch (1)</span>: If you roll 1 on a die, re-roll to check for a Botch. If a 1 is rolled again, you Botch, meaning you fail very badly. For any other number, your d6 roll is just a 1. Bonus rolls from Exploding dice do not Botch.
    <br>
    The GN is given a great deal of lattitude to be creative when determining the effects of Botching under various circumstances, but they should always be fair. Whenever a Character Botches, they get +1 Experience Point because we learn the most from our greatest failures.
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Tables</span>: Number column headers (d6, d66, d666) indicate that you must roll one, two, or three d6s (one per number column) to get a random row.
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="section-header">Rounding</span>: When a rule involves a fraction, always round down.
  </div>
</div>
